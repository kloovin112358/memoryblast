# memoryblast
Small web app created for my data structures course. Takes in a set of integers from a user, randomizes them, and quickly displays them back to the user. The user is then asked to recall the order in which they were displayed.

Built on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [TypewriterJS](https://github.com/tameemsafi/typewriterjs).
